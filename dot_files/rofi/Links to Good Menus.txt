That's it, These themes are now installed on your system to the .config/rofi folder.
Note : These themes are like an ecosystem, everything here is connected with each other in some way. So... before modifying anything by your own, make sure you know what you doing.


Tips

Simple way to execute scripts
There's a $HOME/.config/rofi/bin directory, which contains links to each script. you can execute these links to open any applet, menu, launcher or powermenu.

You can add $HOME/.config/rofi/bin directory to your $PATH variable so that entering powermenu in the terminal (or executing this command) will summon the Powermenu. you can do it by -

In bash

# Add directory to the $PATH variable

echo "PATH=$PATH:~/.config/rofi/bin" >> ~/.profile



In zsh (oh-my-zsh)
# Edit .zshrc and add this line
export PATH=$HOME/.config/rofi/bin:$PATH



Note: after doing this, your $PATH variable won't be updated, so you will need to log out and then back in to be able to summon the menus this way.




Usage

With polybar

An example to use these APPLETS with polybar by adding modules and giving full paths of selected applet, eg: ~/.config/rofi/applets/menu/backlight.sh or simply name, eg: applet_backlight if you followed the method above -

[module/backlight]
type = custom/text
content = 

content-background = ${color.bg}
content-foreground = ${color.cyan}

click-left = ~/.config/rofi/applets/menu/backlight.sh &



## Or...



[module/backlight]
type = custom/text
content = 

content-background = ${color.bg}
content-foreground = ${color.green}

click-left = applet_backlight






With i3wm

You can call the scripts by giving full path, eg: ~/.config/rofi/bin/menu_powermenu or follow method above to call the menu in one word. Then add these lines to your i3 config file -

set $mod Mod4
set $Alt Mod1
bindsym $mod+m exec --no-startup-id menu_mpd
bindsym $mod+n exec --no-startup-id menu_network
bindsym $mod+p exec --no-startup-id ~/.config/rofi/bin/menu_powermenu
#etc
